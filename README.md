## Commands

`local-assets` uses subcommands for its execution pattern

### local-assets start

Recursively copy the contents from the subdirectory paths specified by the "path" (e.g. `/assets`) from each dependency (and devDependency if that setting is on) to the "path" relative to project root. E.g. from dependency `my-dependency` files and folders in `node_modules/my_dependency/assets` into `./assets`.

### local-assets set-path <newPath>

Establish the relative path to both receive assets from and load them into your root project

### local-assets set-usedev

Use development dependencies (in `devDependencies`) as well as main `dependencies` to find assets

### local-assets set-nodev

Do not use development dependencies.
